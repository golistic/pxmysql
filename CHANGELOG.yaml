        patches:
          - version: v0.9.7
            date: 2023-08-15
            fixed:
              driver:
                - Properly deallocate prepared statements when using the connection methods
                  `ExecContext` and `QueryContext` preventing the server to reach maximum
                  prepared statements
            refactor:
              general:
                - Cleanup dependencies and use `golistic/xgo` instead of the now deprecated
                  subpackages within `golistic` or `github.com/geertjanvdk/xkit`
            build:
              general:
                - Go version has been upped to 1.21 to make it clear that we eventually might
                  use some features from that version
          - version: v0.9.6
            date: 2023-08-09
            fixed:
              driver:
                - `pxmysql.QueryContext()` will now correctly return empty Rows-object when
                  result has no rows, instead of returning `sql.ErrNoRows`
                - (!) Go `sql` driver is now named `pxmysql` so it aligns with the package name;
                  we do not keep backward compatibility
                - We support the driver name "mysql" as some projects need to use this name. When
                  this is needed, load anonymous sub-package `github.com/golistic/pxmysql/mysql`

            fixed:
              - Fixed including query part when getting string representation of DataSource.
              - Fixed slash detection when not using schema name together with query part.
          - version: v0.9.1
            date: 2023-02-03
            fixed:
